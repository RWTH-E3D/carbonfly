## How to install?

### Step 1: Install WSL

Install WSL 2 with Ubuntu-20.04 (should also work with Ubuntu-22.04, not tested) in a terminal window (e.g. PowerShell), also see [WSL Documentation - How to install Linux on Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install):

1. `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04`

2. Open `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`, you will see the following console. Please set up your WSL, also see [Set up a WSL development environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-username-and-password)

3. Once you have finished setting up, you should see the following welcome message:

### Step 2: Install OpenFOAM v10

Install OpenFOAM v10 in WSL - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (should be able to find it in the Windows menu, with an orange icon), also see [Download v10 | Ubuntu](https://openfoam.org/download/10-ubuntu/):

1. `sudo sh -c "wget -O - https://dl.openfoam.org/gpg.key > /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/openfoam.asc"`
2. `sudo add-apt-repository http://dl.openfoam.org/ubuntu`
3. `sudo apt-get update`
4. `sudo apt-get -y install openfoam10`

> Tip: Ctrl+V doesn't work in Ubuntu, use right-click to paste

As described in OpenFOAM documentation, complete the following:

5. Find the `.bashrc` file in the user's home directory, e.g. using Windows File Explorer: `Linux/Ubuntu-20.04/home/user/.bashrc` and open the file using any text editor app e.g. [Notepad 3](https://github.com/rizonesoft/Notepad3)

<img src="./pics/install_openfoam_01.png" alt="find .bashrc file" width="50%">

6. At the bottom of that file, add `source /opt/openfoam10/etc/bashrc` and save the file.

7. Restart WSL and test with `simpleFoam -help` in a new WSL window:

### Step 3: Install Carbonfly

#### Manual installation

1. Download `.zip` file (or source code) of latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/RWTH-E3D/carbonfly/releases)
2. Unzip the file
3. Copy the `carbonfly` folder to the Rhino 8 script path: `%AppData%\McNeel\Rhinoceros\8.0\scripts`

> Note: If you have just installed Rhino, the `scripts` folder may not yet exist. Please manually create a new `scripts` folder at this path `%AppData%\McNeel\Rhinoceros\8.0`.

4. Copy the `Carbonfly` folder (under `grasshopper/UserObjects`) to the `%AppData%\Grasshopper\UserObjects`

> Note: If you have just installed Rhino, the `Grasshopper` folder may not yet exist. Please run Grasshopper in your Rhino first. The folder will be created after the first run.

<img src="./pics/manual_installation_copy_grasshopper_user_objects.png" alt="manual installation copy grasshopper user objects" width="50%">

5. Restart Rhino and Grasshopper. You should now see Carbonfly in the tabs:

6. To help you get started quickly, we've prepared numerous examples. See [Examples](./examples).

### Step 4: Install ParaView (optional)

Although [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) (for post-processing) should be automatically installed in the WSL environment during OpenFOAM v10 installation, it is still recommended to install an additional [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) instance in the Windows environment. This allows for more convenient viewing of results and post-processing after simulations.

After simulation, simply double-click the automatically generated `.foam` file in the Carbonfly case folder (see [Examples](./examples)) to open ParaView and view simulation results for post-processing:
