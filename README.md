## Key Features

1. **Indoor ventilation CFD**: Run steady-state and transient simulations of CO2 transport, airflow, and buoyancy-driven temperature.
2. **Rhino-to-CFD in "one click"**: Use Rhino/Grasshopper geometry. Carbonfly handles meshing and other setups - no OpenFOAM text files to edit.
3. **Plug-and-play boundaries**: Presets for inlets, outlets, and walls etc., with sensible defaults you can tweak.
4. **Fast what-if studies**: Change flow rate, supply temperature, CO2 concentration, and diffuser placement and quickly rerun for comparison.
5. **Visualization-ready outputs**: Exports a standard OpenFOAM case for viewing CO2/velocity/temperature/pressure etc. in ParaView.

**See our [Examples](./examples):**

    <td>Based on WSL 2 (Ubuntu-20.04) &amp; OpenFOAM v10. Solver <code>buoyantReactingFoam</code> which supports multi-species with enhanced buoyancy treatment. The reaction is disabled and only the mixing, mainly driven by buoyancy, is considered.</td>

    <td>‚úÖ Done (v0.2.0)</td>
    <td>LOD0 Manikin is a simplified human model focused on CO2 dispersion. It is represented by straight lines and basic geometric volumes, without body part subdivision. Breathing is simplified to mouth breathing only, with no nasal passage. This abstraction is well suited for multi-occupant scenarios where reduced CFD mesh size and computational cost are essential.</td>
