A lightweight, easy-to-use Python API and toolbox for indoor CO2 CFD simulations in Grasshopper based on OpenFOAM and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

## Key Features

1. **Indoor ventilation CFD**: Run steady-state and transient simulations of CO2 transport, airflow, and buoyancy-driven temperature.
2. **Rhino-to-CFD in "one click"**: Use Rhino/Grasshopper geometry. Carbonfly handles meshing and other setups - no OpenFOAM text files to edit.
3. **Plug-and-play boundaries**: Presets for inlets, outlets, and walls etc., with sensible defaults you can tweak.
4. **Fast what-if studies**: Change flow rate, supply temperature, CO2 concentration, and diffuser placement and quickly rerun for comparison.
5. **Visualization-ready outputs**: Exports a standard OpenFOAM case for viewing CO2/velocity/temperature/pressure etc. in ParaView.

## Roadmap

| Feature | Status | Implementation Details |
|-|-|-|
| Transient and steady-state CFD simulation of indoor CO2 / temperature / velocity etc. for mechanical ventilation | ‚úÖ Done (v0.1.0) | Based on WSL 2 (Ubuntu-20.04) & OpenFOAM v10. Solver `buoyantReactingFoam` which supports multi-species with enhanced buoyancy treatment. The reaction is disabled and only the mixing, mainly driven by buoyancy, is considered.|
| Natural ventilation through open windows | ‚è≥ Planned | - |
| Manikins with different levels of detail | ‚è≥ Planned | - |
